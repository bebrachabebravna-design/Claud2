 * Montserrat is served from `public/` rather than Google's CDN so a render never
 * depends on the network — the headless browser here does not trust the egress
 * proxy's certificate, and a missing font would silently fall back mid-render.
 *
 * Google ships one subsetted file per script, so each is registered against the
 * same family with its own unicode-range: Cyrillic for the copy, latin for
 * digits and the URL, latin-ext for the ruble sign. `loadFont()` holds the
 * render until each face is ready.
